# Intro_to_tensorflow Directory:

File in this directory are excerise based on the course of [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow) form coursera.org.
- [Basic Exercise v1](https://github.com/zhx281/Tensorflow-course/blob/master/Intro_to_tensorflow/Basic_Exercise_v1.ipynb) or <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/zhx281/Tensorflow-course/blob/master/Intro_to_tensorflow/Basic_Exercise_v1.ipynb">

  	- This notebook contain multiply excerise from the week 1 to week 3 of the course. The first excerise is a simple neural netwrok for prediction house price base on rooms the house have. The second excerise is a classification model trying to classify the correct hand written digits from 0 - 9. Finally, the third excerise is an improvement on the second excerise with multiply convolution layers and maxpooling layers.
- [Happy or Sad v1](https://github.com/zhx281/Tensorflow-course/blob/master/Intro_to_tensorflow/Happy_or_Sad_v1.ipynb) or <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/zhx281/Tensorflow-course/blob/master/Intro_to_tensorflow/Happy_or_Sad_v1.ipynb">

  	- In this notebook, we are going to create a model to predict if the person is happy or sad. It is the 4th exercise in the course, and the goal is to use multiply convolution layers to reaches a 100% accucary on training of 80 images. In this exercise we also experiment with the ImageDataGenerator function from keras.preprocessing.image to help us easily preprocess the images for training.

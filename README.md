- [Dog_vs_Cat_v1.ipynb](https://github.com/zhx281/Tensorflow-course/blob/master/CNN/Dog_vs_Cat_v1.ipynb)
	- This ipython notebook demonstrate the skills of how to preprocess image dataset using the keras preprocess library and building a simple 3 convolutional neural network with maxpooling layers to predict the images to either a cat or a dog. Also a understanding of overfitting, but looking a training and validation histories.

# Tensorflow-course
Practice using Tensorflow 2.0 to reproduce projects and results from the deeplearning.ai course on coursera.org

## CNN Directory:

File in this directory is projects based on the course of [Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow) from coursera.org. 
(Note: The ipython notebooks are reproduction of the projects not direct copies.)

	- This ipython notebook demonstrate the skills of how to preprocess image dataset using the keras preprocess library and building a simple Convolutional Neural Network with 3 Conv2D layers with ReLU activations and 3 MaxPooling2D layers, 1 Flatten layer, 1 Fully Connected layer with ReLU activation, and 1 Sigmoid output layer to predict the images to be either a cat or a dog. I also demonstrate understanding of overfitting from analysing plot history of training loss and accuracy, and validation loss and accuracy.
